# API Fetcher & Cache ‚Äî TypeScript Learning Project

[![Coverage](coverage/badge.svg)](https://luckyhegde6.github.io/ts105/coverage/)
![Build](./build-badge.svg)

A fully-typed, asynchronous data-fetching and caching library demonstrating Promises, async/await, retry logic with exponential backoff + jitter, structured error handling, and strong TypeScript inference.

## üß© Goals

- Understand Promises, async/await, and how TypeScript infers async return types.
- Learn how to design robust retry + caching mechanisms.
- Showcase typed error classes and discriminated unions.
- Build a clean CI-ready TypeScript library with test coverage.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

### üß† Example usage

```typescript
import { ApiFetcher, NetworkError } from 'api-fetcher-cache';


interface Todo { id: number; title: string; completed: boolean; }


const fetcher = new ApiFetcher<Todo[]>({
baseURL: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com',
cacheTTL: 60_000,
retries: 3,
});


(async () => {
try {
const todos = await fetcher.fetchData('/todos');
console.log('Fetched', todos.length, 'todos');
} catch (err) {
if (err instanceof NetworkError) console.error('Network issue:', err.message);
}
})();
```

### üß™ Scripts

- npm run build ‚Äî Type-check project.

- npm run test ‚Äî Run Jest tests.

- npm run lint ‚Äî Lint all files.

- npm run coverage ‚Äî Generate coverage report.

### üß∞ Features
